Pre-submit:
Write a few simple test cases if sample is not enough.
Are time limits close? If so, generate max cases.
Is the memory usage fine?
Could anything overflow?
Make sure to submit the right file.
If your code is disorganized and you're not sure about what it's doing, it's probably not going to pass.

Wrong answer:
Read the full problem statement again.
Have you understood the problem correctly?
Are you sure your algorithm works? 
Try writing a slow (but correct) solution.
Can your algorithm handle the whole range of input?
Did you consider corner cases (n=1) or other special cases?
Print your solution! Print debug output, as well.
Is your output format correct? (including whitespace)
Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
Any uninitialized variables?
Any undefined behavior (array out of bounds)?
Any overflows or NaNs (shifting ll by 64 bits or more)?
Confusing N and M, i and j, etc.?
Make sure that you deal correctly with numbers close to (but not) zero.
Are you sure the STL functions you use work as you think?
Add some assertions, maybe resubmit.
Create some test cases to run your algorithm on.
Go through the algorithm for a simple case.
Go through this list again.
Explain your algorithm to a teammate.
Ask the teammate to look at your code.
Go for a small walk, e.g. to the toilet.
Rewrite your solution from the start or let a teammate do it.

Runtime error:
Have you tested all corner cases locally?
Any uninitialized variables?
Are you reading or writing outside the range of any vector?
Any assertions that might fail?
Any possible division by 0? (mod 0 for example)
Any possible infinite recursion?
Invalidated pointers or iterators?
Are you using too much memory?
Debug with resubmits (e.g. remapped signals, see Various).

Time limit exceeded:
Do you have any possible infinite loops?
What's your complexity? Extended TL does not mean that something simple (like NlogN) isn't intended.
Are you copying a lot of unnecessary data? (References)
Avoid vector, map. (use arrays/unordered_map)
How big is the input and output? (consider FastI)
What do your teammates think about your algorithm?

Memory limit exceeded:
What is the max amount of memory your algorithm should need?
Are you clearing all data structures between test cases?
Delete pointers?
