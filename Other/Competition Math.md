# Competition Math
 
## Pre-Olympiad

If you have no prior contest experience or score <90 on AMC 10:
 * Look up AMC if you don't know what it is. ;)
 * You should make sure that you are familiar with standard prealgebra concepts. (This may not be as easy as you think!)
 * Doing AMC 8 or MathCounts chapter contests is helpful.
 * AoPS
   * Use Alcumus extensively. 
   * FTW! may or may not be helpful for improving speed and accuracy. 
   * ["Stupid Mistakes"](http://artofproblemsolving.com/articles/stupid-mistakes)
   * Introduction Series
 * [This](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3h1217349p6066794) is an excellent article pertaining to MathCounts preparation. 
 
If you consistently score 90+ on AMC 10:
 * Master all of Introduction Series / Alcumus.
 * Once you believe that you are familiar with all the material, do past tests! Note that AMC 12's before 2010 are comparable or possibly easier than current AMC 10's. 
 * Create a record of your results and review as necessary.
 
If you consistently score 120+ on AMC 10:
 * Master all the topics in the intermediate series.
 * Do past AIME's! Follow the time limit, and don't look up solutions unless you are absolutely stuck. [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B95dMIY7fstOemlzdThlZjFCUnc?usp=sharing) are some additional AIME resources.
 * Do as many contests as you can (USAMTS, ZIML, etc.)
