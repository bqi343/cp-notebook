## Introduction

In competitive programming contests, one must solve well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified constraints ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)). Typically, the most popular language is C++, followed by Java and Python.

## Notes

I am currently not updating the following pages:

 * README's for most implementations
 * tables and solutions for non-platinum USACO contests

If you would like to contribute, provide feedback, or encourage me to update something, please email me at *bqi343@gmail.com* or submit a pull request. If you have a question, it may be answered by another file in this folder.

## Getting Started

I recommend that you use C++, even if you already know some other language such as Java or Python (see notes). A solid foundation in math (ex. AIME qualification) can help greatly.

 * [C++ Tutorial](https://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cplusplus.com%2Fdoc%2Ftutorial%2F&sa=D).

 * [Schedule for Beginners](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-schedule-to-follow-for-becoming-better-at-competitive-programming-for-beginners)
 * [E869120 Tutorial](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/53341)

Assuming you know how C++ input/output works, you should soon be able to advance from USACO Bronze. After that, you can start doing past USACO Silver problems as well as the USACO training pages. Also, participate in other contests such as [AtCoder Beginner.](http://atcoder.jp/)

## How do you train for USACO Platinum?

* Do as many (high-quality) contests as possible.
  * Make sure to [upsolve](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsolve) after the contest ends!
* Work through past problems. See Contests -> README:Problems.
* Use the tags to learn new topics as necessary.
  * see implementation / USACO categories
  * [A2OJ](https://a2oj.com/)
  * [Problem Topics (Morass)](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/55274)
