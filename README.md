## Introduction

In competitive programming contests, one must solve well-defined problems by writing computer programs under specified constraints ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming)). Typically, the most popular language is C++, followed by Java and Python.

## Notes

I am currently not updating the following pages:

 * README's for most implementations
 * tables and solutions for non-platinum USACO contests

If you would like to contribute, provide feedback, or encourage me to update something, please email me at *bqi343@gmail.com* or submit a pull request. If you have a question, it may be answered by another file in this folder.

## Getting Started

I recommend that you use C++, even if you already know some other language such as Java or Python (see "resources"). A solid foundation in math (ex. AIME qualification) can help greatly.
